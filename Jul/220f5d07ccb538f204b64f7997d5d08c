Cape Town – National Police Commissioner Riah Phiyega has announced rewards of R50 000 for any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrators in each of the recent car hijacking incidents. A four–year–old boy, Taegrin Morris, was dragged from his mother's car in Reiger Park to Boksburg during a hijacking. The boy later died. In another incident, five-year-old Mongezi Phike, who went missing on Tuesday following a hijacking in Bronkhorstspruit, has been found. Speaking to journalists in Cape Town on Monday, Phiyega said rewards of R50 000 were being offered for any information that could lead to the arrest of the perpetrators in each case. “Even though the child in Bronkhorstspruit has been found, the reward remains because we would like to be assisted with detailed information so that we can get to the perpetrators,” she said. Last Tuesday, it was reported that Mongezi and his father were in a car at an intersection in Masada, Bronkhorstspruit, when four men approached the vehicle. Two of them were armed. The father was reportedly bound hand and foot with wire, while his head was covered with a plastic bag and tape was wrapped around his neck, left for dead. The man’s personal belongings were taken and he was later found abandoned at a construction site. The hijackers sped off with his son. Earlier today, Gauteng Premier David Makhura visited the family of Taegrin. During a visit to the family home, the premier called for a speedy investigation of the case. “I have ordered police to step up their investigations into this young boy’s death. This act was heartless. Dragging a small boy for 8km shows they could have been under the influence of drugs, as we know the community has a drug problem,” said Premier Makhura. Premier Makhura is currently visiting the family of Mongezi, who has been returned to his parents safe and unharmed after the horrible hijacking of his father’s car in Delmas. – SAnews.gov.za
