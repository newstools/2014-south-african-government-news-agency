By More Matshediso Pretoria – Schools from around the country will vie for top honours in the upcoming 14th South African Schools Choral Eisteddfod (SASCE). EThekwini Municipality will play host to the colourful music event from 15 -17 July at the Durban ICC, the Department of Basic Education said on Friday. Music lovers of all ages are encouraged to go and watch the competition, as it will allow learners, who are talented and passionate about music, to outshine each other on the national stage. The 14th edition of SASCE coincides with South Africa’s 20 years of freedom and democracy. “Music has long been one of the tools used to emancipate people, to spread messages of hope and celebrate our gains. It is thus fitting that the 2014 [edition] is reflective of this celebratory mood,” the department said in a statement. Learners will perform pieces by Qinisela Sibisi such as Never Again and Lilizela Mzansi. “It comes naturally that music is a centrepiece of celebrating the attained democracy and the strides made by this country in the past 20 years.” The department said government aimed to ensure that learners are safe for the entire school holiday period, while preparing them for various careers in music. SASCE, established in 2001, remains one of the most crucial school enrichment programmes that promote unity in diversity, national reconciliation, a new South African national identity, social transformation and social cohesion among learners. – SAnews.gov.za
