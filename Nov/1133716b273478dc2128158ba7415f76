Pretoria - SADC Facilitator and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa will on Tuesday return to Lesotho to consolidate the implementation of recently signed agreements in that country, his office said on Monday. The visit, according to spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa, will “consolidate the implementation of provisions of the recently signed security and political agreements in the country”. This will be Deputy President Ramaphosa’s eighth visit to the Kingdom of Lesotho since the signing of the Maseru Facilitation Declaration and the Maseru Security Accord. The declaration led the country's parliament being reconvened in October after its dissolution in December last year, and provides for elections to be held in February 2015. The accord also provides for the three senior security officers in the Lesotho Defence Force and Lesotho Mounted Police Service to take leave of absence and undergo working visits on their related fields of work in SADC or Commonwealth countries. Deputy President Ramaphosa is expected to return to South Africa later on Tuesday. - SAnews.gov.za
