Pretoria - Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has welcomed the appointment of a commission of enquiry into the KwaZulu-Natal Education Department's fiscal management and procurement procedures. This after the provincial department received qualified audits for three consecutive years, with the Auditor General having found a number of irregularities in the department’s financial management practices. The department said the Auditor General’s findings on the non-payment of service providers in the province has made it necessary for such an intervention and it hopes to bring an end to the continuous financial challenges that have plagued the department. “The Department of Basic Education has committed itself to ensuring that it aims for unqualified audits in all departments. As the National Department, we are ready to support provinces where there is a need, including sourcing the relevant skills for this purpose,” the department said. - SAnews.gov.za
