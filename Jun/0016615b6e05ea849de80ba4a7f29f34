Pretoria - Limpopo Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Fanie Masemola, has condemned the killing of a police officer in Ritavi, in Tzaneen. “Any attack and the killing of our police officers will not be tolerated, and I have already formulated a task team by Hawks members to apprehend these cold blooded killers and ensure that they face the full might of the law. No stone will be left un-turned in our efforts to establish who was involved and bring them to book,” said Masemola. Masemola was reacting to the killing of a lieutenant Yezindaba Meshack Shikati, 54, from Ritavi SAPS, who was shot and killed while executing his official duties on Sunday. Shikati, together with colleagues, responded to a complaint at Mabuza Tavern, at Patanage village. While investigating the enquiry, they were unexpectedly ambushed by two unknown suspects. According to Masemola, the two suspects emerged from the nearby bushes, one carrying a rifle and another a handgun, started shooting indiscriminately at the two officers, killing Shikati instantly while the other was unhurt. The two gunmen took the officers official handguns and fled the scene. Masemola said the killing is a serious concern not only for the SAPS management, but also for the community at large. “Limpopo SAPS will not be deterred by this terrible act in their quest to ensure that all people in the province feel safe.” He urged members of the community to be vigilant and come forward with any information which might lead to the arrest of these cold-hearted criminals. Public with information have been urged to contract Col Mabotja at 0713517198 or nearest police station or call the Crime Stop number at 08600 10111. Callers can remain anonymous. – SAnews.gov.za
