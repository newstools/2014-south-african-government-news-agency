Pretoria – Gauteng Human Settlements MEC Jacob Mamabolo has appealed to all service providers that are doing business with the department to exercise patience while they are dealing with the processing of invoices and payments. “We are resolving some problems that are of an administrative nature and we should be able to finalise them by the end of October. We will however deal with them in batches and each week process the claims that have been resolved,” MEC Mamabolo said. MEC Mamabolo added that in the meantime, the department has started with the process of engaging with individual contractors to resolve some of those issues. He said if the contractors have not been contacted by their respective Regional Managers as yet, they should expect to be contacted soon. The Regional Managers will issue them with a letter explaining how far they are with the process of their claims. “Those invoices that do not have issues have already been processed and the department will continue to process them to be paid at every weekly cycle/run. The department remains committed to paying its service providers within 30 days of receiving the invoice as is expected,” MEC Mamabolo assured the service providers. For enquiries about payment claims, contractors are asked to contact the regional managers at their respective regions across the province. – SAnews.gov.za
