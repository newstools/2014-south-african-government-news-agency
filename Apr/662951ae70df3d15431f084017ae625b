Pretoria – Classes have returned to normal in the North West, following the recent protests in Bloemhof, Bodibe and Itsoseng. “The positive response of thousands of learners and educators who turned up for learning and teaching to commence at schools in Bloemhof, Bodibe and Itsoseng is encouraging and should be applauded,” said North West Premier Thandi Modise on Monday. Premier Modise said that she is hopeful that all learners in both areas will be in school by tomorrow after provincial education authorities reported a 98% attendance. “The recovery plan tailored according to learning and teaching time lost at each of the over 45 schools should ensure that the province is on track to claim the top spot in the matric results at the end of the year,” said Premier Modise. She said the provincial government will be following up on all issues raised during engagement with the communities. Premier Modise said that the Executive Council intervention team will also engage the Khunotsoane protestors, outside Zeerust, where schooling was still affected at Khunotsoane Primary and Motsaalore Secondary School as roads were still blockaded. – SAnews.gov.za
