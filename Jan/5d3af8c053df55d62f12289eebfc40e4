Pretoria – Police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with the plot to kill members of the task team dealing with Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir’s case. SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant General Solomon Makgale said the suspect is a 34-year-old woman, a Sergeant within the Crime Intelligence environment. “It is believed that the woman played a key role in the murder plot by allegedly providing software to track the investigators,” Makgale said. Nine cell phones were confiscated from the suspect. The first four suspects, who include three men and a woman aged between 23 and 32 years, were arrested last Thursday in an intelligence- driven operation. During the operation, police recovered firearms, police blue lights and sirens. The firearms included an R5 rifle and two 9mm pistols. The suspects were arrested for allegedly plotting to kill forensic investigator Paul O'Sullivan and crime intelligence officer Colonel Nkosana "Killer" Ximba, who are investigating a kidnaping case which involves Krejcir, Sandton businessman Desai Luphondo, and two members of the Hawks - Warrant Officers Samuel Modise Maropeng and George Jeff Nthoroane. – SAnews.gov.za
