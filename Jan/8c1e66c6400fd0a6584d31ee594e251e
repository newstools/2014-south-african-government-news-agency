Pretoria - North West Premier Thandi Modise has urged the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) to respect the rights of non-striking workers. “We respect AMCU’s choice to exercise its constitutional right to strike, having complied with provisions of the Labour Relations Act. We would, in the same breath, also appreciate it if the union can ensure that the rights of non-striking workers are respected and that violence is avoided at all costs during the planned strikes,” said Modise on Monday. The union goes on strike this week after it made an announcement that its members voted in favour of striking at the world’s largest platinum miner, Anglo American Platinum, in addition to their previous vote to strike at Lonmin and Impala Platinum. Amcu said it expected its estimated 100 000 members at the three mines to participate in the strike. The union is seeking a minimum monthly wage of up to R12 500 for entry-level workers - more than double current levels. The mining houses have said they cannot afford the steep increase. Modise said she hoped the parties would still be able to address their concerns ahead of the planned strike on Thursday. “We will always encourage frank and honest discussions, as we are convinced that such dialogue is a demonstration of commitment by all stakeholders to peaceful co-existence and mutual benefit based on openness, trust and respect, and that has the interest of all stakeholders at heart,” Modise said. - SAnews.gov.za
