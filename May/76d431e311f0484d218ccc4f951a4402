Pretoria - North West Premier Thandi Modise has appealed to mining houses and the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) to act responsibly to avoid violent confrontations. This comes as strikers gathered outside the premises of Lonmin’s Marikana platinum mine on Wednesday. Workers have been in a 16-week wage dispute in the platinum belt. “Resorting to threats of dismissals, court actions and mobilising for intensified intimidation and violence against non-striking workers and those who wish to return to work, instead of reaching a settlement to end the strike, will only serve to exacerbate the already volatile situation that demands urgent responsible action by all parties to avert another Marikana,” Premier Modise said. She called on traditional leaders and community leaders in the platinum belt not to succumb to pressure to drag their communities into the wage dispute, as it remains a matter between mining houses and members of Amcu. Workers affiliated to Amcu in the platinum belt have been on strike since January 23, demanding a salary of R12 500 a month. – SAnews.gov.za
