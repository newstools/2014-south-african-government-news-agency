Pretoria – Following the successful commemoration of International Nurses’ Day on Monday, Helen Joseph Hospital in Johannesburg, has dedicated the entire week to nurses with a host of activities planned to take place at the hospital. International Nurses' Day is celebrated annually on 12 May, the anniversary of the founder of modern day nursing, Florence Nightingale's birthday. The theme for 2014 is ‘Nurses: A Force for Change – A vital resource for health’. In South Africa, the first black nurse, Cecilia Makiwane, is also remembered. Nurses mostly use the day to focus on the challenges facing the profession, and what can be done to address those challenges. Kick starting the week-long celebration at Helen Joseph on Monday, nurses, dressed in white, led a march around the block of the hospital as a sign of their commitment to the delivery of quality healthcare. The march was followed by an address by the Hospital CEO, Dr Raymond Billa and the Head of Nursing, Matron Peele, where nurses also renewed their commitment to the profession by lighting candles and taking the nurses’ pledge. Today, the hospital hosted a nursing imbizo, which looked at areas such as labour issues and the financial wellness of staff. On Wednesday, nurses will light a lamp in remembrance of Florence Nightingale, as well as outline in detail the significance of the day and the theme for this year. Motivational speakers will also address healthcare workers. On Thursday, healthcare workers will set up health awareness stalls at the pharmacy foyer to showcase the different services available at the hospital. To end the week’s celebrations on Friday, a nurses quiz will be held at the hospital’s dining hall to empower health care professionals as well as to test their knowledge in the nursing field. – SAnews.gov.za
